  Fetch full vehicle specifications from a VIN using the CarsXE API. Use this when the user
  provides a VIN and wants to know details about a vehicle (make, model, year, engine, trim,
  equipment, etc.).

When the user provides a VIN and asks about vehicle specs, details, or information:

1. Use the `carsxe_specs` tool with the VIN provided.
2. Present the results in a clean, organized format covering:
   - Basic info: Make, Model, Year, Trim
   - Engine: type, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, torque
   - Transmission & drivetrain
   - Fuel type and economy (city/highway/combined)
   - Body style, doors, seats
   - Standard & optional equipment
3. If the API key is missing, tell the user to configure it by running `gemini extensions config carsxe`.
